Gen 1 files are used for the C7 Corvette and Camaro platforms.  Copy the desired map.gpx file to the root of the SD card that you will use in the car PDR slot.  Do not rename the file as the PDR system will only look for map.gpx.

Gen 2 files are used for the C8 Corvette, CT4-V Blackwing, and CT5-V Blackwing.  Copy the desired .gpx files to the root of the SD card you will use in the PDR slot.  I recommend keeping the file name the same as the track name, but it must keep the .gpx file extension.  In the car, use the PDR app in the infotainment system to select the desired gpx file for the track you are visiting.
